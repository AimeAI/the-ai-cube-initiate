---

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. **Server-Side API Configuration - HIGH PRIORITY**
**Issue:** No actual server-side API endpoints deployed
- Vite dev server handles API routes locally only
- Production deployment will fail API calls
- Payment processing will be completely broken

**Impact:** Complete payment system failure, no subscriptions possible

**Fix Required:**
```bash
# Create Vercel serverless functions
mkdir -p api
# Move server routes to Vercel functions format
cp src/server/routes/createCheckoutSession.ts api/create-checkout-session.ts
cp src/server/routes/stripeWebhook.ts api/stripe-webhook.ts
```

### 2. **Environment Variables Not Configured**
**Issue:** `.env.server` contains placeholder values
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY>
```

**Impact:** Payment processing, authentication, and database operations will fail

**Fix Required:** Configure actual production values in deployment environment

### 3. **Database Schema Not Applied**
**Issue:** Supabase migrations exist but may not be applied to production database
- User subscriptions table may not exist
- RLS policies may not be configured

**Impact:** Subscription management completely broken

### 4. **Missing Production Domain Configuration**
**Issue:** Hardcoded localhost URLs and missing CORS configuration
- Stripe webhooks won't work
- Authentication redirects will fail

---

## üü† HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 1. **Test Failures**
- 2 failing tests in SacredButton component
- Canvas/Three.js rendering issues in test environment
- AuthProvider context errors

**Fix:** Update test expectations and improve test setup

### 2. **Admin Route Security**
**Issue:** All game routes use `AdminProtectedRoute` instead of `ProtectedRoute`
- Admin bypass mechanism exists but is not properly secured
- Regular users may not be able to access paid content

### 3. **Payment Flow Validation**
**Issue:** No end-to-end payment testing in production environment
- Webhook signature validation not tested
- Subscription activation flow not verified

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Limited error boundaries for 3D components
- No graceful degradation for WebGL failures
- Missing user-friendly error messages

---

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 1. **SEO & Performance**
- Bundle size: 695KB for Three.js (acceptable but could be optimized)
- Missing meta descriptions for game pages
- No sitemap for dynamic routes

### 2. **Accessibility**
- Limited ARIA labels on 3D components
- No keyboard navigation for games
- Missing alt text for some images

### 3. **Monitoring & Analytics**
- No production error tracking configured
- Missing user behavior analytics
- No performance monitoring

---

## ‚úÖ WORKING WELL

### 1. **Security Implementation**
- Proper environment variable separation
- Row Level Security (RLS) configured
- Authentication middleware implemented
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### 2. **Code Quality**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Proper component structure
- Error boundaries implemented
- Code splitting configured

### 3. **User Experience**
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Professional UI components
- Smooth 3D animations

### 4. **Architecture**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper state management with Zustand
- Lazy loading for performance
- Modern build pipeline
