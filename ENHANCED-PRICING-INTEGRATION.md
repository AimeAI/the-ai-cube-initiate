## 🛠️ Integration Steps

### Step 1: Replace Pricing Component

Replace your existing `PricingSection.tsx` with the enhanced version:

```bash
# Backup current pricing section
mv src/components/PricingSection.tsx src/components/PricingSection.backup.tsx

# Use enhanced version
mv src/components/EnhancedPricingSection.tsx src/components/PricingSection.tsx
```

### Step 2: Update Stripe Configuration

Add the enhanced Stripe configuration alongside your existing one:

```typescript
// In your main app file or where you import pricing
import { getEnhancedPlans, getPriceId } from './lib/enhancedStripe';
```

### Step 3: Update Server Routes

Add the enhanced checkout session handler:

```typescript
// In your server setup (e.g., server.ts or app.ts)
import enhancedCheckoutRouter from './routes/enhancedCheckoutSession';

app.use('/api/enhanced-checkout', enhancedCheckoutRouter);
```

### Step 4: Configure Stripe Products

Create these products and prices in your Stripe dashboard:

#### Products to Create:
1. **AI Cube Explorer** (prod_explorer)
2. **AI Cube Initiate** (prod_initiate) 
3. **AI Cube Master** (prod_master)
4. **AI Cube Family** (prod_family)

#### Price IDs to Create:
```
Monthly Prices:
- price_explorer_monthly: $8.00
- price_initiate_monthly: $15.00
- price_master_monthly: $25.00
- price_family_monthly: $20.00

Yearly Prices:
- price_explorer_yearly: $64.00
- price_initiate_yearly: $120.00
- price_master_yearly: $200.00
- price_family_yearly: $160.00
```

### Step 5: Update Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.server`:

```bash
# Enhanced pricing feature flags
ENABLE_YEARLY_BILLING=true
ENABLE_PRICING_TESTS=false
YEARLY_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE=20
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Customizing Pricing

Edit `src/config/pricing.ts` to modify:
- Price amounts
- Feature lists
- Hooks and CTAs
- Testimonials

### A/B Testing

The system includes built-in A/B testing support:

```typescript
// Enable testing in enhancedStripe.ts
export const ENHANCED_PRICING_TESTS = {
  initiate: {
    testId: 'initiate_pricing_v2',
    variants: {
      'control': { monthlyPrice: 15, yearlyPrice: 120, weight: 50 },
      'variant_a': { monthlyPrice: 12, yearlyPrice: 96, weight: 50 }
    }
  }
};
```

### Theme Customization

The enhanced pricing maintains your Sacred AI theme with:
- `void-black` backgrounds
- `electricCyan` and `neonMint` accents
- Gradient text effects
- Backdrop blur effects

## 📊 Analytics Integration

### Tracking Events

Add these events to your analytics:

```typescript
// Pricing page events
analytics.track('Pricing Page Viewed');
analytics.track('Billing Toggle Changed', { period: 'yearly' });
analytics.track('Plan Selected', { plan: 'initiate', billing: 'yearly' });
analytics.track('Checkout Started', { plan: 'initiate', amount: 120 });
```
