# Snake³: The Axis Mind - Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

Snake³: The Axis Mind is a 3D adaptation of the classic Snake game, set in an 8×8×8 cube grid with movement along all three axes. The game features a unique "fading tail" mechanic where the snake's tail becomes invisible after 3 segments, creating an additional challenge for players to remember their path. Players must collect Data Nodes while avoiding collisions with their own tail or the grid boundaries.

### 1.1 Project Goals

- Ensure smooth performance across various devices

### 1.2 Target Users

- Casual gamers looking for a new twist on a classic game
- Players interested in spatial reasoning challenges
- Users across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
