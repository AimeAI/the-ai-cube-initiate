# Supabase Integration Requirements

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for integrating Supabase into the application. The integration will cover user authentication, database setup, and secure handling of environment variables.

## 2. Goals
- Implement secure and reliable user authentication using Supabase.
- Set up a database schema to store user data and subscription plans.
- Ensure all sensitive information, such as API keys, are managed securely using environment variables.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Authentication
- [ ] **FR-AUTH-001:** Users shall be able to register with a valid email address and a strong password.
- [ ] **FR-AUTH-002:** Users shall be able to log in using their registered email and password.
- [ ] **FR-AUTH-003:** Users shall be able to reset their password if forgotten.
- [ ] **FR-AUTH-004:** The application shall provide a mechanism to securely store and manage user sessions.
- [ ] **FR-AUTH-005:** The application shall handle authentication errors gracefully (e.g., invalid credentials, network issues).

### 3.2 Database Setup
- [ ] **FR-DB-001:** The application shall create a "users" table to store user information.
    - [ ] **FR-DB-001.1:** The "users" table shall include the following columns:
        - `id` (UUID, Primary Key, auto-generated)
        - `email` (TEXT, Unique, Required)
        - `password_hash` (TEXT, Required)
        - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP with time zone, default now())
        - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP with time zone, default now())
    - [ ] **FR-DB-001.2:** The "users" table may include additional columns such as `name`, `profile_picture_url`, etc.
- [ ] **FR-DB-002:** The application shall create a "subscription_plans" table to store subscription plan details.
    - [ ] **FR-DB-002.1:** The "subscription_plans" table shall include the following columns:
        - `id` (UUID, Primary Key, auto-generated)
        - `name` (TEXT, Required)
        - `description` (TEXT)
        - `price` (NUMERIC, Required)
        - `interval` (TEXT, e.g., "month", "year", Required)
        - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP with time zone, default now())
        - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP with time zone, default now())
- [ ] **FR-DB-003:** The application shall create a "user_subscriptions" table to manage user subscriptions.
    - [ ] **FR-DB-003.1:** The "user_subscriptions" table shall include the following columns:
        - `id` (UUID, Primary Key, auto-generated)
        - `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key referencing "users.id", Required)
        - `plan_id` (UUID, Foreign Key referencing "subscription_plans.id", Required)
        - `start_date` (TIMESTAMP with time zone, Required)
        - `end_date` (TIMESTAMP with time zone)
        - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP with time zone, default now())
        - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP with time zone, default now())

### 3.3 Environment Variables
- [ ] **FR-ENV-001:** The application shall retrieve Supabase API keys and other sensitive configuration from environment variables.
- [ ] **FR-ENV-002:** Environment variables shall be loaded securely, and not hardcoded within the application.
- [ ] **FR-ENV-003:** The application shall provide default values for environment variables if they are not set.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **NFR-SEC-001:** All passwords shall be securely hashed and salted before storing in the database.
- [ ] **NFR-PERF-001:** Authentication and database operations shall be performant and responsive.
- [ ] **NFR-AVAIL-001:** The application shall be highly available and resilient to failures.
- [ ] **NFR-MAINT-001:** The codebase shall be well-documented and easy to maintain.

## 5. Edge Cases
- [ ] **EC-AUTH-001:** Handle invalid email formats during registration.
- [ ] **EC-AUTH-002:** Handle weak password attempts during registration.
- [ ] **EC-AUTH-003:** Handle account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
- [ ] **EC-DB-001:** Handle database connection errors gracefully.
- [ ] **EC-ENV-001:** Handle missing or invalid environment variables.

## 6. Constraints
- [ ] **CN-TECH-001:** The application will use Supabase for authentication and database management.
- [ ] **CN-TECH-002:** The application will use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
- [ ] **CN-TECH-003:** The application will be developed using [Specify the technology stack, e.g., React, Node.js, etc.].

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC-AUTH-001:** Users can successfully register with a valid email and password.
- [ ] **AC-AUTH-002:** Users can successfully log in with their registered credentials.
- [ ] **AC-AUTH-003:** Users can successfully reset their password.
- [ ] **AC-DB-001:** The "users" table is created with the specified columns.
- [ ] **AC-DB-002:** The "subscription_plans" table is created with the specified columns.
- [ ] **AC-DB-003:** The "user_subscriptions" table is created with the specified columns.
- [ ] **AC-ENV-001:** Supabase API keys are loaded from environment variables.
- [ ] **AC-SEC-001:** Passwords are securely hashed before storage.
