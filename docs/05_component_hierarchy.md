## 3. Component Relationships and Data Flow

### 3.1 State Management

The game uses a centralized state management approach:

1. **Game State**: Managed at the SnakeCubeGame level and passed down to child components
   - Snake position and segments
   - Data node position
   - Score and collected nodes count
   - Game status (playing, paused, game over, victory)
   - Timer and elapsed time

2. **Settings State**: User preferences and settings
   - Game speed
   - Voice guidance settings
   - Visual preferences (high contrast mode)
   - Control scheme

3. **UI State**: Managed by individual UI components
   - Modal visibility
   - Animation states
   - Input focus

### 3.2 Data Flow

1. **Top-Down Props Flow**:
   - Game state flows from SnakeCubeGame down to all child components
   - Settings flow from SnakeCubeGame to components that need them

2. **Bottom-Up Event Flow**:
   - User inputs (keyboard, touch) are captured by input handlers
   - Events are passed up to SnakeCubeGame for processing
   - Game state is updated based on events
   - Updated state flows back down to components

3. **Side Effects**:
   - Game loop runs as a side effect in SnakeCubeGame
   - Voice announcements are triggered as side effects of state changes
   - Performance monitoring runs as a side effect in the 3D scene

## 4. Rendering Optimization Strategies

### 4.1 Component Optimization

1. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - Only render visible snake segments
   - Conditionally render UI screens based on game state
   - Only render mobile controls on mobile devices

2. **Memoization**:
   - Memoize expensive components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Use useMemo for expensive calculations

3. **Refs for Stable References**:
   - Use refs for 3D objects that don't need to trigger re-renders
   - Store animation references in refs

### 4.2 3D Rendering Optimization

1. **Instanced Rendering**:
   - Use instanced meshes for similar objects (snake segments)
   - Share geometries and materials

2. **Level of Detail**:
   - Reduce geometry complexity based on distance or performance
   - Simplify distant objects

3. **Adaptive Quality**:
   - Adjust pixel ratio based on performance
   - Reduce particle counts when FPS drops
   - Disable non-essential effects when needed

## 5. Responsive Design Approach

### 5.1 Desktop Layout

- Full 3D scene with detailed effects
- Keyboard controls
- Minimal UI overlay
- Optional orbit controls for camera manipulation

### 5.2 Tablet Layout

- Scaled 3D scene
- Touch controls alongside keyboard support
- Larger UI elements
- Fixed camera angles with simplified controls

### 5.3 Mobile Layout

- Vertically oriented layout
- Prominent touch controls
- Simplified visual effects
- Optimized performance settings
- Larger UI elements with higher contrast

## 6. Accessibility Considerations

### 6.1 Visual Accessibility

- High contrast mode for better visibility
- Configurable visual effects
- Clear visual indicators for direction and position
- Scalable UI elements

### 6.2 Auditory Accessibility

- Voice guidance for key game events
- Configurable voice settings (rate, pitch, volume)
- Text alternatives for all audio cues

### 6.3 Motor Accessibility

- Configurable game speed
- Alternative control schemes
- Pause functionality
- Touch-friendly controls on mobile

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Component Testing

- Unit tests for individual components
- Snapshot tests for UI components
- Interaction tests for user inputs

### 7.2 Integration Testing

- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between components
- Test game state transitions

### 7.3 Performance Testing

- Monitor and test FPS across devices
- Test memory usage during extended play
- Verify responsive behavior across screen sizes
